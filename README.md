pattern-library
======

* **Current stable version:** 2 ([release-2](https://github.com/codeforamerica/pattern-library/releases/tag/release-2.1) tag / linkable [url](https://style.codeforamerica.org/2/))
* **Current development version:** 3 ([master](https://github.com/codeforamerica/pattern-library/tree/master) branch / linkable [url](https://style.codeforamerica.org/3/))

The pattern library serves as the base CSS and organizing styles for [codeforamerica.org](http://codeforamerica.org). The pattern library is also a living style guide that explains how to use our CSS to build websites.

## Who's working on it

* [David Leonard](https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/david-leonard/): code, bugfixes, planning for the future
* [Michal Migurski](https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/david-leonard/): hosting, code, many things

## Background

Code for America's communications and tech teams worked with Brighton web design firm [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com/) and Colorado branding firm [Dojo4](http://dojo4.com/) to create a new visual design and front-end for the Code for America website. This pattern library is used as the base for the following:

* CfA main site: [github](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeforamerica.org) / [website](https://www.codeforamerica.org)
* CfA blog: [github](https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfawp2012) / [website](https://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/)
* CfA brigade site: [github](https://github.com/codeforamerica/brigade-alpha) / [website](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade)

## How to use it to build websites

1. **[Read the docs.](http://style.codeforamerica.org)** Complete documentation of the pattern library with copy-and-pastable code snippets is available at [http://style.codeforamerica.org](http://style.codeforamerica.org).
2. **Pick your version.** The current stable version is 2. The current development version is 3. 
3. **Add links to your document head.** For example, like this:

```
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="//style.codeforamerica.org/2/style/css/main.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="//style.codeforamerica.org/2/style/css/layout.css" media="all and (min-width: 40em)">
  <link href="//style.codeforamerica.org/2/style/css/prism.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  ...
</head>
```
Note that you should include your chosen version number (i.e. **/2/**) in the url path.

## Versioning

Note: we are still updating our versioning process. Your feedback is welcome in the [issues](https://github.com/codeforamerica/pattern-library/issues).

Releases are currently seperated between major (full number releases, i.e. 0, 1, 2) and minor (dot releases, i.e. 2.1). Minor changes are essentially bug fixes and are intended to be fully backwards compatible. Minor changes don't trigger a new URL to a new stylesheet (i.e. release 2.1 is still available from http://style.codeforamerica.org/2/style/css/). If you link directly to our stylesheets, you will automatically get minor releases.

Major releases will attempt to preserve backwards compatability, but may introduce some quirks or require markup changes after upgrade. Please [watch the repo](https://github.com/codeforamerica/pattern-library/subscription) to get updates on when major releases are available. The current stable major release is 2. The current development major release is 3.

## How to deploy it
